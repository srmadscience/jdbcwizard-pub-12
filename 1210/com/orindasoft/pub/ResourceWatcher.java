/**
* A static class for keeping track of free memory.
*
* <p>This class is used by ReadOnlyRowSet's caching mechanism. If 
* the JVM appears to be running out of memory ReadOnlyRowSet will 
* decline to add a query result to its cache. This class is
* problematic as some JVM's wait till the absolute last moment (i.e. 
* no free memory left at all) before getting more memory.
* <p> 
* Future versions of JDBCWizard may make this class a lot
* smarter.

  * until the limit on memory is reached. The problem is that the JVM may wait till
  * the last moment before allocating memory.
  * Most JVM's will have allocated all the memory they can before they get to the point where
  * only MIN_SAFE_MEMORY_PCT is free. If free memory falls to this level then it
  * is unlikely that the JVM will allocate any more. Continuing to extend memory
  * structures such as HashMaps etc is dangerous as there is a real chance of running
